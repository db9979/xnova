Description
This script works by when an attack happens, the script searchers for any fleets on mission ACS Attack with the same fleetgroup number as the original fleet.  The fleets are then entered into an array, and passed through to the combat engine. The comabt engine is mostly X-Nova code, it was then converted to work with a different game by Tom so full credit to him for the new parts of that file (calculateAttack.php). If was then modified by me again to work with X-nova and my ACS script.


Features
ACS,  style user interface.

Top 100 / Hall of Fame


Status
The script is nearly completed. The only this that remains to be sorted is that sometime you get very odd results in battles. Also joining acs fleets don't effect the mission time.
