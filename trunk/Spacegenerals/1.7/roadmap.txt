FINDINGS
	MissionCaseEvoAttack: presumeably no longer in use
	includes/aks.php: strings not moved; file needs complete rewrite (template);
		should even be no longer used (integrate aks in normal combat system)
	calc.php, contact2.php, raketenangriff.php, verband.php: strings not moved; needs a template first
	common.php, common-secure.php, windows-common.php: needs template
	simulator.php: the combat code again? for what? -> needs rewrite
	wing.php: seems to be identical with alliance.php; should be merged
	tmp/: may have no purpose
	agb.php: is more a template than a php; should be moved to language folder
